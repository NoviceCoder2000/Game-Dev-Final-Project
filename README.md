## Description
This is a 2D space shooter game where players need to shoot enemies while avoiding friendly ones. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, and pressing "R" restarts the game.

## Features
- Enemy and friendly ships
- Asteroids
- Score and health system
- Game over and restart functionality

## How to Play
- Use your mouse to move your aim.
- Left-click your mouse to shoot.
- Shoot asteroids for extra points. Shoot Enemy Ships (Black) and Avoid Shooting Friendly Ships (Blue). Failing to shoot enemy ships on time or shooting friendly ships would reduce your life which results to a "game over."
- Press "R" to restart the game after it ends or "Esc" to exit the game.
